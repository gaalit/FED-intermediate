### Starting the Project:

#### 1. run `npm i` to install all the needed dependencies

#### 2. to start the app run `npm start`

#### 3. navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project

### Aproach:

#### - This project was built using a mobile-first approach to styling as this reduces complexity when making an application responsive.

#### - This application is reponsive on any screen size. I've added a hamburger menu for mobile size as this type of navigation is simpler to use on smaller screens.

### Possible Issues:

#### I had a CORS policy issue when trying to access the api routes on my chrome browser, the workaround was to download the Moesif CORS chrome extension. This is not ideal for security reasons but there are no other options to fix this on the front-end. Alternatively, Firefox works fine, without any cors policy issues,

### Last Notes:

#### I enjoyed working on this mini-project!
